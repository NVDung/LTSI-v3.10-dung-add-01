Environment
-----------

Target environment for running tests

Two machines
1. Controller
   - Machine running Linux which controls the test
   - Has ssh access to board
2. Board
   - board to be tested
   - Provides ssh access to board

Root File System of Board
- I use NFS root
- On some boards it is possible to use local flash
- For tests with minimal dependencies it may be possible to use an initrd



1. Ensure that sshd is running on board
   - Ideally this should happen automatically on boot

2. Manually install test on board
   - Data, libraries, programs etc...

3. Ensure any hardware required by board is in place
   e.g. SD card inserted

4. Host executes tests by sshing to board

   e.g.
   ssh root@armadillo800eva /root/tests/ltsi-3.10/sdhi.0/write-1k.sh
   ssh root@armadillo800eva /root/tests/ltsi-3.10/sdhi.0/write-10M.sh
   ssh root@armadillo800eva /root/tests/ltsi-3.10/sdhi.0/unbind-bind-write.sh

5. Tests should exit with a value of 0 on success and any other value on error

   Tests may output informational messages to stdout or stderror

   Tests should output errors to stderror
